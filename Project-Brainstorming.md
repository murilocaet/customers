# Overview about the project steps

## Architecture Ideas

**1.** Redis

**2.** Databases: MongoDB or MySQL ???

**3.** Docker

**4.** Spring Boot

**5.** ReactJS or AngularJS

**6.** Nginx

**7.** AWS

**8.** Load Balance

**9.** Terraform


### Redis - Used

I decided to use it to control the cache. It was created a flag to trigger the cache update. When needs update, this update is always performed before the next request.
I used a Redis Container

### Databases - Used MongoDB

I decided to use MongoDB instead of MySQL just for studying
I used a MongoDB Container

### Docker - Used 

I decided to use a Compose file to share the project easily 

### Spring Boot - Used

Just because I love it

### ReactJS - Used

I chose it because I like it better than Angular, but it's okay to work with Angular. I use both in my work

### Nginx - Used

I was thinking to create a proxy_pass with upstream, but I give up and used it only to store the site on Ubuntu.
Depending on project goals It would be interesting to use

### AWS - Used

Used to share a running version of the project

### Load Balance - Not Used

The same case of Nginx load balancer. Depends on project goals

### Terraform - Used

I decided to use it to practice more and because it makes provisioning faster


# Problems faced

Using the AWS Ubuntu IP address to access the project, for some reason, the ReactJS site doesn't find the Backend server to connect. 

It was possible to get access and receive a JSON response from the terminal inside of the VM, with the 'curl' command. But from the site, maybe it could be trying to use localhost access to the server, I don't know, and creating this issue, I need to read more to find a workaround for it. 

Executing all containers in my dev environment this issue doesn't occur.
